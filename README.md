This is a python program I made to try and make my own programming language. I know this is not the way you go about doing this, but I’m new to python and wanted to test my skills with a challenging but still easy project

I’m 17 still in high school and before python, I only really learned small amounts of C# before this


[ HOW TO USE ]

Fisrt off, I used Pycharm to make this with terminal emulator turned on (os and sys didn't work for me unless I turned them on)

There is only 4 functions right now

do, end, say, !s

I will go over each one

A “do” function is similar to a for loop, you can loop anything put inside it for a # of times

“end” is used at the end of a do loop

“say” is your print statement

“!s” starts your program when you finish typing it out

There are only two real syntax things…

You write each thing on a different line
And you use % on any strings or integers


[ Simple Examples ]

say
Hello, World!%
!s

This code would print “Hello, World!”

do
10%
say
Hello, World!%
end
!s
This code would do the same thing, But 10 Times

Oh and also if your wondering why it's named Sip, it just stands for Super interpreted Python

[ Future Ideas ]
So by the end of this project, I want to be able to create a simple text base game with this

I also want it to read from a file instead of being edited inside the program itself...
I might figure out something

Varibles Probobly

Nothing else I can think of
